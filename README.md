# Quadrotor 2D RL

This project is rather old and uses old technologies.

This is 2D quadrotor simulator that learns how to fly and achieve goal with reinforcement learning. See video

It is quite tricky to build and run it since you'll need tensorflow compiled in dynamic library libtensorflow.so for RL, cocos2-x for building the simulator. I have plans to separate this code into 2 repos with RL server and quadrotor simulator.
